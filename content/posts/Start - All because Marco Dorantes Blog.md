It's a very sudden thought.  
I start a personal blog,  
only write by myself,  
and only use English.  
It's about all my life.  
From my born  
To the last if I can.  
Today when I search something about software architect,  
I went to this blog [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/marcod/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/marcod/)  
then I saw a blog named "After 18 years posting"  
it's quite shack me.  
I want be a man like him.  
don't need post every day.  
but post 18 years and more.  
let's go.
