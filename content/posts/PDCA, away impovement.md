## What is PDCA?
PDCA stands for Plan, Do, Check, Act. It is a cycle of quality management processes that aims to continuously improve and optimize processes by implementing and monitoring the results of corrective and preventive measures. PDCA is often used in conjunction with other quality management techniques, such as Six Sigma or Total Quality Management (TQM).

In PDCA, the following steps are typically followed:

Plan: Define the goals and objectives of the process, identify the necessary resources and establish a plan to achieve the desired results.
Do: Implement the plan and conduct the process according to the established standards and procedures.
Check: Evaluate the results of the process and compare them with the established goals and objectives. Identify any issues or errors that need to be addressed.
Act: Take corrective and preventive measures to address any issues or errors identified during the Check step. Implement corrective measures to resolve problems and prevent them from reoccurring.
The PDCA cycle is repeated continuously to improve and optimize processes. The cycle ensures that any identified issues or errors are addressed in a timely manner, leading to improved quality, efficiency, and overall performance of the process.
